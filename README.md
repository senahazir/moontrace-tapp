# MoonTrace: Hardware Debugging and Verification Engine üåù
MoonTrace is built around a two-stage parsing engine. The first stage analyzes Verilog/SystemVerilog code to build a signal dependency graph. The second stage traces signal activity from simulation output, typically a VCD file generated by ModelSim, Verilator, or similar tools. This produces a simulation log that can be used with any LLM to help track down design bugs, unexpected behavior, or other issues. The log can also be fed into the LLM to automatically generate verification tests based on what happened during simulation.
